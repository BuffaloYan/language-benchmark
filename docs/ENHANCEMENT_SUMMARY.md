# Benchmark Enhancement Summary

## âœ… Completed Enhancements

### 1. Increased Dataset Size
- **Before**: 1 million random integers
- **After**: 10 million random integers
- **Impact**: 10x more data to process

### 2. Added Prime Number Counting
Added CPU-intensive prime number detection after sorting:

**Algorithm Features:**
- Optimized trial division method
- Checks divisibility up to âˆšn
- Skips even numbers after 2
- Time complexity: O(âˆšn) per number

### 3. Enhanced Timing Metrics
Each implementation now reports:
- **Sort Time**: Time to complete merge sort
- **Prime Time**: Time to count prime numbers
- **Total Time**: Combined execution time
- **Prime Count**: Number of primes found (for verification)

### 4. Updated All Language Implementations

**Languages Enhanced:**
- âœ… Python (`mergesort_python.py`)
- âœ… JavaScript (`mergesort_javascript.js`) 
- âœ… Java (`MergeSort.java`)
- âœ… Go (`mergesort.go`)
- âœ… Rust (`mergesort.rs`)

### 5. Updated Benchmark Infrastructure
- Modified `benchmark.py` to extract total execution time
- Updated `README.md` with new complexity information
- Enhanced report generation for dual-phase timing

## ðŸ”¥ Performance Results (Sample)

Testing with 10M integers on the current system:

| Language   | Sort Time | Prime Time | Total Time | Speedup |
|------------|-----------|------------|------------|---------|
| Python     | 17.14s    | 25.30s     | 42.44s     | 1.0x    |
| JavaScript | 2.07s     | 0.83s      | 2.89s      | 14.7x   |
| Java       | 1.01s     | 0.59s      | 1.60s      | 26.5x   |

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits of Enhancement

1. **More CPU-Intensive**: Prime counting adds significant computational load
2. **Better Differentiation**: Larger performance gaps between languages
3. **Dual Algorithm Test**: Tests both sorting and mathematical computation
4. **Real-World Complexity**: More representative of actual applications
5. **Verification**: Prime count serves as additional correctness check

## ðŸ“Š Usage

Run the enhanced benchmark:
```bash
python3 benchmark.py
```

Or test individual implementations:
```bash
python3 mergesort_python.py
node mergesort_javascript.js
java MergeSort
```

The benchmark now provides a much more comprehensive evaluation of language runtime performance for CPU-intensive tasks!
